Cant be assed with formatting


Run main.py:
```
> python3 main.py PORT_NUMBER
```
PORT_NUMBER is an optional flag and is 12000 by default

then go to:
http://LOCAL_IP:PORT_NUMBER/index.html

for the base page

404 error page can be found by going to any other file:

http://LOCAL_IP:PORT_NUMBER/a_file_that_doesnt_exist.png
